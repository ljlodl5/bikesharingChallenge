# Bikesharing

## **Overview**
Utilizing citi-bike data (csv) representing NYC bike usage, the goal is to ascertain how the NYC model can be used for Des Moines. 
Rather than present the data in basic tables, Tableau will be used to provide a visual story and present what else may need to be known before investing in CitiBike for Des Moines. 


 
### **Results**: 

* **Visual Support: NYC data**

Enclosed are seven support documents representing NYC CitiBike data
 
1) Checkout Time for Users:

2) Checkout Times by Gender:

3) Trips by Weekday per Hour:

4) Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour):

* **Other Opportunities**

There are two other focus points that can be considered in order to drill down how the model may be suitable for Des Moines.
1) Understanding what is also around the start (lat/longitude) and end points (lat/longitude) may help businesses to set up a model that works in other cities. NYC is a commuter city, Des Moines is not. 
Therefore it stands to reason the subscriber base will likely not be as large. Non-subscribers are looking for other more one-time/tourist-like usage which may be a model more in line with smaller cities.   
2) Based on #1, additional review will be needed in order to determine if potential start and end points for Des Moines will drive longer rides and thus more wear and tear on the bikes.  
One-time usage with tourist intentions are probably closer to the NYC weekend model and thus a focus may be needed to understand NYC weekend ridership.
